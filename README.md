## Description
We present a 4 DOF pesticide spraying robot structure. The goal of this robot is to spray pesticides in a nursery where there are shrubs and trees of variable sizes. For maximum spraying efficiency, our robot arm should spray all around the plant leaves which might be at different heights. To tackle this problem we propose a RPRR robot with a spraying nozzle attached to the end effector. For practical purposes, we took realistic link lengths and masses for kinematics and statics calculation.

## Install dependencies
Our code works on Ubuntu 16 + Ros kinetic + python 3.6. Except for that, the below packages are also needed(type the commands in terminal):

```sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-control```

```sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-controllers```

```sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control```

## How to run the code
* move the whole folder "**mobile_manipulator_body**" to your catkin workspace under **src** folder
* type ****catkin_make**** to build the package, or use the command:
```catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps mobile_manipulator_body```
* make sure you install other needed dependency packages

## Test the Robot Arm in Rviz
```roscd mobile_manipulator_body/urdf/```

```roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=robot_arm.urdf```

Change the Fixed Frame to **world**. Next, you can move the arm using the sliders.

## Launch the Robot Arm in Gazebo
```roscd mobile_manipulator_body/launch/```

```roslaunch mobile_manipulator_body arm_gazebo_control.launch```


## Future work
* Add joint limits in Gazebo simulation 
* Attach this robot arm onto a mobile robot base
